Section F: 

F.  Justify the package delivery algorithm used in the solution as written in the original program by doing the following:
1.  Describe two or more strengths of the algorithm used in the solution.
-The nearest neighbor algorithm is simple to implement compared to other complex algorithms.
-The nearest neighbor algorithm is suitable for non-linear and random data such as determining the next shortest distance out of remaining distances.

2.  Verify that the algorithm used in the solution meets all requirements in the scenario.

-The algorithm used in my solution does meet all requirements for the scenario.

3.  Identify two other named algorithms that are different from the algorithm implemented in the solution and would meet all requirements in the scenario.
-Two other named algorithms include Dijkstra's algorithm and greedy algorithm.

a.  Describe how both algorithms identified in part F3 are different from the algorithm used in the solution.
Greedy algorithm takes into account the most optimal solution at a certain point in time, but may not lead to the most optimal path.
Dijkstra's algorithm starts at an initial vertex, then finds the shortest path to the next vertex, and keeps repeating until it reaches the final vertex. 
In addition, a pointer to the previous vertex is taken. The algorithm terminates once all the vertices are visited.
